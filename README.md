#### Executive summary

- Billions in losses every year in organizations due to Cyberattacks
- Intrusion Detection is critically important to prevent Cyberattacks
- Commercially available IDS can detect many attacks but may miss some attacks 
- A machine learning approach to intrusion detection using classification can be a cost effective technique for organizations in classifying network traffic as safe and not safe

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?

- To help prevent massive economic losses due to Cyberattacks

#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?

- Use machine learning classification models to classify network traffic as "Safe" or "Not safe"

#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question?

- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection

#### Methodology
What methods are you using to answer the question?

   Naive Bayes - BernoulliNB
   Decision Tree Classifier
   Random Forest Classifier
   XGB Classifier
   Bagging Classifier
   AdaBoostClassifier

#### Results
What did your research find?

BaggingClassifier, Random Forest Classifier and XGB Classifier are the best performing classifiers and they can detect intrusions and anamolies with over 99.5% accuracy.

#### Next steps
What suggestions do you have for next steps?

Use other techniques such as Neural networks
